# DSND---PROJECT  
Jump Into Boston and Seattle Airbnb Data:

Airbnb takes a unique approach toward lodging. Airbnb offers  home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. On Airbnb, 
you can find places to crash on your backpacking trip or you can find a place to stay for a month. Also, if you want 
to rent out extra space in your own home, you can host through Airbnb and make money for allowing a guest to stay the 
night.
