  
# Jump Into Boston and Seattle AirBnB Data:

Airbnb takes a unique approach toward lodging. Airbnb offers  home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. On Airbnb, 
you can find places to crash on your backpacking trip or you can find a place to stay for a month. Also, if you want 
to rent out extra space in your own home, you can host through Airbnb and make money for allowing a guest to stay the 
night.

# Project Overview:

Based on Standard Process of Data Mining, the Boston and Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated. 

Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

  Is there any noticeable difference between Seattle and Boston Airbnb?

  What are the most important features to estimate Airbnb rental price?

  What are the top amenities people needs most?
