Airbnb takes a unique approach toward lodging. Airbnb offers  home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. On Airbnb, 
you can find places to crash on your backpacking trip or you can find a place to stay for a month. Also, if you want 
to rent out extra space in your own home, you can host through Airbnb and make money for allowing a guest to stay the 
night.

# [Project Overview:](https://vicky-code-creator.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/)

Based on Standard Process of Data Mining, the Boston and Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and analysed. 

Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

  * Is there any noticeable difference between Seattle and Boston Airbnb?

  * What are the most important features to estimate Airbnb rental price?

  * What are the top amenities people needs most?
  
# [File Descriptions:](https://vicky-code-creator.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/)
  
  * A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
  
  * Two datasets: Detailed Listings data for Boston and Seattle which were collected. Dataset Link: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

# [Analysis:](https://vicky-code-creator.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/)

I found some interesting information during the analysis of data sets and I would be sharing them through this project.


# [Approach:](https://vicky-code-creator.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/)

  * Compared the Boston and Seattle Airbnb dataset.
  
  * Established a machine learning model to predict the rental price for both cities.
  
  
  * Used the feature importance of the trained model and checked if they make any sense.
  
  * Listed all the important amenities to get a better feeling on how host can make more money by providing better services to meet customersâ€™ need.
